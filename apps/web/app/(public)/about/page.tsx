          Ascendly exists because career growth shouldn&apos;t require a second degree or a stack of
          $20 courses you never finish. We bundle expert-led courses across business, tech, design,
          data, AI, and career skills into one membership — organized as structured paths, not a video
          dump.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-neutral-600">
          Our members are office workers, freelancers, career changers, and self-directed learners
          who want a reliable, calm place to build skills on their own schedule.
